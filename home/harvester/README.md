## Installation

If you attempt netboot.xyz, try to confirm the images exist first - when I tried, 1.0.0 was the only option the netboot.xyz UI offered, and the URLs for the images were broken. Changing to a newer version explicitly didn't work.

When in doubt, fallback to booting from ISO with keyboard and monitor attached.
