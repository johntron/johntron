# Prusa i3 Enclosure

## Goals

* A fully-contained enclosure to contain dangerous fumes
* Something that looks like furniture instead of a power tool (I keep it in my office)
* Something ergonomic - tired of bending down to inspect
* System for keeping filament dry that can accomodate any number of spools
* Option to use MMU2S or not
