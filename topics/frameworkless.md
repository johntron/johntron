# Frameworkless

## Concerns

-   Initial training overhead vs. readily-available workforce skills
-   there's value in "building a project on top of a common base that is readily familiar, well documented and easy to pick up by outsiders"
-   Skills/knowledge developers will have to acquire won't transfer to future projects (may be less enthusiastic about adopting them)
-   Company may not be aligned with custom "infrastructure" - they may force a switch so they can hire relevant developers
-   Consider open-sourcing
-   Be comfortable taking hit training new devs
-   "The lack of just being able to google stuff slowed everyone down massively. The lack of extensive code examples slowed everything down. Doing the easy stuff was amazingly fast. Want to do something creative or complicated? NO!! That custom framework held back the talented programmers in so many ways."
