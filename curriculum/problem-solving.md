# Problem solving methodologies

## General process

* Defining the problem: discovery, shaping, simplification, etc.
* Choose approach
* Generate possible solution(s)
* Evaluate possible solution(s)
* Choose a solution and implement
* Verify solution


## Things to consider

* Does the problem require creative solution? Should you use abstract thinking?
* What's the goal of the problem - why solve it, what's it trying to answer?
* What rules can be applied to solve the problem?
* Pragmatics and semantics - how context contributes meaning to the problem (pragmatics) and the interpretation of the problem (semantics)


## Strategies

From Wikipedia's page on Problem Solving:
* Abstraction: solving the problem in a model of the system before applying it to the real system
* Analogy: using a solution that solves an analogous problem
* Brainstorming: (especially among groups of people) suggesting a large number of solutions or ideas and combining and developing them until an optimum solution is found
* Divide and conquer: breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, solvable problems
* Hypothesis testing: assuming a possible explanation to the problem and trying to prove (or, in some contexts, disprove) the assumption
* Lateral thinking: approaching solutions indirectly and creatively
* Means-ends analysis: choosing an action at each step to move closer to the goal
* Method of focal objects: synthesizing seemingly non-matching characteristics of different objects into something new
* Morphological analysis: assessing the output and interactions of an entire system
* Proof: try to prove that the problem cannot be solved. The point where the proof fails will be the starting point for solving it
* Reduction: transforming the problem into another problem for which solutions exist
* Research: employing existing ideas or adapting existing solutions to similar problems
* Root cause analysis: identifying the cause of a problem
* Trial-and-error: testing possible solutions until the right one is found
