## Questions to answer

* What are the important dimensions?
* What data is unnecessary and can be compressed?
* Is seeing micro (individual datapoints) and macro (e.g. averages or variation) views together useful?
* Can multiple dimensions share an axis (e.g. time)?
* Can you use small, multiple versions of the same design graphic to provide more detail (small multiples)?
