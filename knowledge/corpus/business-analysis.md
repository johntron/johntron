## Tips
* Have a milestone you’re working on and have a plan to get there! 
* Are we working on the thing that is the most important? (Avoid the trap of working on the thing that can be worked on). It’s better to work on unblocking the most important thing. 
* Story titles: This is the OUTCOME expected at the end of the story. (Rather than an exact task) 
* * There are occasions when I break this to keep things clear 


## Story writing

Keep them short. Too much information can discourage implementors from focusing on the task at hand (they stop looking at it). Long stories are often a smell indicating the story should be broken up.

Don't separate stories for testing, accessibility, etc. These should be part of normal work, and if there's too much in one story, that story should be broken up.

Titles to avoid:

* Technical descriptions - phrase in terms of outcome to 1) ensure the real goal is achieved and 2) avoid churn / confusion when implementation details change
* Stories f

Make sure story includes release plan – it's not done until it's in production. Often times getting it to production changes things, affects other stories, or even changes the entire delivery strategy.

Parts of a story:
* Why – explain why it's important and being prioritized
* Context – details about the business that might matter (keep it short)
* Acceptance criteria - how am I going to know this is complete? 
* Tech notes - everything else (just dump it)

For a team without a BA: 
* Use kickoffs to flesh out details and identify overlooked aspects
* Have a teammate be BA champion for each epic

## Meetings

Sprint planning: 
* Do we know the next most important work? Story titles is all that’s needed
* Assign the epic champion - assign people to write the stories? 

Story time: 
* Go through the stories and estimate
