# Browser performance

## Advice

-   Consider JAM stack (Javascript, API's, pre-build Markup)
-   Understand risks / tradeoffs of doing SSR, esp. regarding SEO (this info is very fluid lately w/advent of newer SPA technologies and Google's improvements in client-side crawlers)
-   Low-hanging fruit (in order): cache static assets at CDN, gzip, minify, HTTP/2, load assets at appropriate time, link rel="preload" critical assets, image compression (webp if possible), defer NFR assets as much as possible
-   Do this first: setup asset inlining with [critical](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical)
-   Most of things in [Nodejs server-side rendering](nodejs-server-side-rendering.md)
-   Use custom user timings to measure the things you really care about, not just TTI
-   If doing SSR, use hrefs instead of onclick, so content doesn't need to wait for JS bundle to become interactive
-   [Optimize images](https://images.guide) â€“ incorporate into build
-   [Lazy load images](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes)
-   Use [`<link rel="pre*" \>` directives](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_link_rel.asp)
-   [Webfont loading strategies](https://github.com/zachleat/web-font-loading-recipes)
-   Example of performance improvements: [oodle-demo](https://github.com/google/oodle-demo/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)
-   Bonus: predictive prefetch with [guess.js](https://github.com/guess-js/guess)

## Gotchas

-   Comparing against a benchmark that isn't apples-to-apples (e.g. a product page with different )
-   Using crude metrics like time-to-interactive instead of ones that reflect performance of specific content (e.g. how quickly CTA's appear and are interactive)

## Outstanding questions

-   Is it finally safe to stop doing SSR?
