# Logging and Monitoring


## Setup for NR
* Installation and newrelic.js
* Use dotenv and commit .env.template for devs
* Example of addCustomAttribute()


# Setup for Splunk
* Basics for Splunk
* Custom logger
* Limitations I've faced and how we worked around


## Using New Relic

* NR One
* Health - visuals at different layers
* Feature roll-out
* Useful dimensions (categories)
* Alerts
* Synthetic monitoring (caveat of using dev)
* Tip: phantom path rollouts using background transactions and Spans
* Tip: recording deployments
* Tip: app crashes and scaling events


## Using Splunk

* Primary use case: getting details on errors quickly
