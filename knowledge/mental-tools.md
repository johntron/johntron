* 3P's - success (however you define that) is mostly influenced by these three:
* * People, process, product
* Planning:
* * Today - actionable things
* * Near term - upcoming but not necessarily actionable things
* * Long term - projects
* * Values - why you do things
* When processing occurs: 
* * compile time
* * deployment time
* * boot – part of runtime, but useful to consider separate
* * runtime
* Ways of organizing:
* * Relations - think of a system as a graph of related entities
* * Index - list with specific methods for finding things
* Parts of an process:
* * Interface - the thing humans / machines interact with
* * Data – stuff the interface works with
* * Services / functions – provides business logic
* * Persistence - makes data durable
* Ways of thinking about a problem:
* * Objects – think OOP
* * Actions – think FP
* How to organize changes:
* * Goal - why?
* * Constraints - things that will remain constant
