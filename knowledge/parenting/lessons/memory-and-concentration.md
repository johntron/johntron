# Memory and concentration

## Prose / inspiration
## What is it?

Your mind is a biological machine, and these are your raw resources. Memory is your ability to hold multiple things in your head at once and recall important information. Concentration is your ability to apply your brain without distraction. Both of these can be improved with practice, but the world will try to distract you. Hone these tools, because they're your defense against distraction.


## Why is it important?

Improving your memory and ability to concentrate help you understand the world around you. Memory allows you to recognize patterns and recall knowledge when it matters most. Concentration give you the freedom to analyse the world around you clearly.
