## What is it?

There's one thing that you were born with, that separates you from everyone else, and you define: you. Your life is yours and nobody else's, which means you're responsible for making it into what you want it to be.


## Why is it important?

Too many people drift through life. We only get one, so it's important to make the best of it. We can only do this by recognizing the responsibility we have to ourself.
