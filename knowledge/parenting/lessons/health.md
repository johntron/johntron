# Health

## Prose / inspiration

## What is it?

Health is what allows you to do the things you want to. It keeps your mind sharp, your body capable, and your energy high. It's the foundation for everything you intend to do – it all starts with health. Without this, your purpose is clouded.

Good health is never guaranteed – unfortunately it takes hard work, and the path to good health is a slippery one. The best strategy is to always be taking small steps forward, one at a time.


## Why is it important?

Poor health minimizes:

* Fun and excitement
* Positivity
* Your impact
* Your ability to cope


## Acceptance criteria

The kid knows when they're:

* Substituting convenience with physical effort (e.g. taking the stairs)
* Eating the right because they know they need it, not because it's tasty or convenient
* Scheduling their own doctors appointments
* Doing some form of physical exertion daily


## Timing

One of the first.

## Implementation
## New ideas, feedback, and results
