# Lesson: Purpose

## Prose / inspiration

"Ain't No Reason" by Brett Dennen


## What is it?

The world is shaped by people. All people have a purpose. Some are lucky enough to choose their purpose. Those that do can work towards it, and shape their world more effectively.


## Why is it important?

Because bad things happen. They happen because:

* We didn't predict them
* We couldn't control them
* Nobody tries to stop it
* Some people are bad
* Some don't know any better


## Acceptance criteria

How will we know the lesson is learned?


## Timing

One of the first.


## Implementation

* Have them create an inspirational playlist


## New ideas, feedback, and results

Where fulfillment comes from ("a higher purpose")
