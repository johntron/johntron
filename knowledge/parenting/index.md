# Lessons for my son or daughter

* What?
* When?
* Why?
* How?


## What?

Life's lessons I learned:

* From my own parents
* Through friends
* With loved ones
* The hard way


## Why?

This set of lessons are the most important thing I can provide - my gift to them. I'll do what I can to give them the best life I can, but they control their future.

These lessons are so their life is:

* Happier
* More fulfilling
* Meaningful
* Impactful
* Theirs


## When?

After they have a happy care-free childhood, but before they need to know each lesson


## How?

Via:

* First-hand experiences
* Discussions
* Instruction
* Agile practices: continuous integration, testing, sprint planning, kanban (lol), retrospectives

Format:

* Prose / inspiration
* What is it?
* Why is it important?
* Acceptance criteria
* Timing â€“ _should this be its own document?_
* Implementation
* New ideas, feedback, and results
